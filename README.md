# SweetLifeTaxi_TemporalSeries

📌 Project Overview
Sweet Lift Taxi collected historical data on taxi orders at airports to improve driver allocation during peak hours. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the number of taxi orders for the next hour, helping the company plan resources more effectively.

🎯 Objective
Forecast hourly taxi demand using historical time-series data.

Ensure the model achieves a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) under 48 on the test set.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, LightGBM, CatBoost, statsmodels

🧪 Models Used
Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

LightGBM

CatBoost

After testing, CatBoost showed the best performance and lowest RMSE on the test set.

📈 Business Impact
An accurate forecast model enables Sweet Lift Taxi to optimize operations, reduce waiting times, and improve customer experience during peak demand periods.
